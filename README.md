The Australian real estate market is one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world, offering a
wide range of properties to both buyers and sellers. For homeowners looking to sell, setting the right
price is a critical, and often emotional, decision. After all, property transactions are among the most
significant financial events in a person's life.

Sellers typically set a listing price based on what they believe their home is worth and what the market
might bear. But things don’t always go as planned. Some properties attract intense buyer interest and
sell for more than the asking price. Others fall short, forcing the seller to accept less than they’d hoped.

If sellers had a way to estimate in advance whether their listed price is likely to be exceeded or undercut,
they could make more informed pricing decisions, better manage expectations, and potentially
maximize their return.
